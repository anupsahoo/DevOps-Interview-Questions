## Introduction 
:information_source: &nbsp;This repository is about Collecting any useful resources and information regarding DevOps and , create a structured roadmap for biggnners

:pencil: &nbsp;Feel free to add more resources by sumitting pull requests

### DevOps Roadmap

  * The following path is opinionated. You can find alternative paths in the [alternative roadmaps section](#alternative-roadmaps)
  * Do NOT attempt to learn everything, especially if you are a complete beginner (the burnout will make you regret you ever heard the word DevOps)
  * Learn enough to say "I know what is DevOps and I understand how to practice it". You can learn everything else by demand or when you feel ready

The must list

Topic | What to learn | Alternatives | Description
:------|:------|:------|:------:
Version Control | [Git](#Learn-git) | None | Version Control is used everywhere and Git is the leading version control technology
Programming | At least one [programming language](#programming) | None. Don't settle for learning only shell scripting  | Anyone who practice DevOps should know programming to some extent
Operating System | [Linux](#operating-systems) | Windows? | Operating Systems is another must when it comes to DevOps
Protocols | DHCP, UDP, TCP, HTTP, SSH | Not as an alternative, you can simply learn later: NFS, NTP, FTP | Learn how these protocols work and what they are used for
Applications | Web Server, Load Balancer, Cache, Database | | Learn how they work and try out some implementations (e.g. MySQL for databases and httpd for web servers)
[System Design](https://github.com/bregman-arie/system-design-notebook) | Availability, Reliability, Scalability, Performance | Learn how to design infrastructure and systems

The second must list :) Seriously though, don't try to master everything in this list and start with something that you are interested in. The order has no meaning in this case.

Topic | What to learn | Alternatives | Description
:------|:------|:------|:------:
Configuration Management and IaC | Ansible and Terraform | CM: Chef, Puppet and Salt. IaC: Pulumi and CloudFormation |
Cloud | Azure, AWS, GCP | OpenStack |
Containers | Podman and Kubernetes| Docker instead of Podman. Nomad instead of Kubernetes | 
CI/CD | Jenkins, GitHub Actions | Gitlab CI, Circle CI, Argo CD |
Logging and Dashboards | Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch and Logstash), Report Portal | Graylog, Splunk |
Monitoring | Prometheus and Grafana | Nagios, Datadog | 

### Alternative Roadmaps

There are other DevOps roadmaps and learn plans out there. If you feel the one above is little bit too much, maybe you'll find these better.
